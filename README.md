### REPORT50 Dashboard

Utilizing the Beautiful Soup library (bs4) and Selenium for web scraping, I extract data from the 'Report50' section on the PEA website. 
This section records instances of false electrical data in households on a monthly basis.

carefully select and categorize the data as per the team's requirements.

Then upload it to a Google Sheet using Python code. 
Subsequently utilize Looker Studio to create comprehensive data boards.
